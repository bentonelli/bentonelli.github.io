title: Bird of the Week
---

Since late 2019, I have been writing a weekly newsletter called "Bird of the Week." The original purpose of the newsletter was to provide much-demanded bird facts to my co-workers. Since starting my PhD, I have continued the newsletter, with the audience expanding beyond my original workplace to subscribers across the US and around the world. Bird of the Week is not to be confused with "Bird of the Day" - a <a href="http://www.morgantingley.com/botd/">yearlong challenge</a> originated in the Tingley Lab.

Bird of the Week is sent out on Wednesdays, and features five facts about a single bird.
