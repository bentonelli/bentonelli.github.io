title: Bird Names for Birds (a map)
---

The American Ornithological Society (AOS) [announced](https://americanornithology.org/american-ornithological-society-will-change-the-english-names-of-bird-species-named-after-people/) in November 2023 that they would be changing the names of North American birds currently named after people (e.g. Cooper's Hawk). Inspired by a water cooler conversation/debate in my lab about where the most eponymous bird species are, I made some maps to find out. Below are "watercolor maps" that overlay the range maps (from eBird status and trends) of eponymous bird species in North America. Darker areas indicate places where more of these species live. So, where are the areas that will have the most bird names changed?

If you go by breeding ranges (green plot above), the coniferous forests of the American West look like the clear winner. Think Townsend's, Wilson's and Macgillivray's Warbler, Clark's Nutcracker, Cassin's Vireo and Hammond's Flycatcher. Meanwhile, the East Coast has very few birds to be renamed. 

![Wintering Ranges BNFB](https://github.com/bentonelli/bentonelli.github.io/blob/master/bnfb_winter_map.png)

If you go by wintering ranges, the winner is basically all of Mexico. Interestingly, the hotspot of eponymous species in the U.S. seems to the Puget Sound region (Anna's Hummingbird, Steller's Jay, etc.)

I hope these maps are entertaining! A couple caveats: 1) These maps are focused on North America, where the AOS will be changing names. 2) they also don't cover species not reported enough to be included in eBird S&T, and exclude most of the seabirds (e.g. Cassin's Auklet). Also, if you would like to use these images elsewhere please email me first!
