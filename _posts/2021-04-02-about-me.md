title: About Me
---

I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> at UCLA in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department, where I study the movement ecology of migratory birds and their pathogens and parasites. Currently, my focus is on developing models for the migratory movements of individual birds - check out the "Research" page for more!

Outside of work, I love running, baking, and generally doing stuff outdoors.
