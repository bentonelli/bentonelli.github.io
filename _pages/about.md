I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA. My research uses big data to understand bird migration, and spefically how species and populations are responding to global change - check out the "Research" page for more!

Outside of work, I love running, baking, birding, backpacking and gardening.
