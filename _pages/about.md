I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA, where I study the movement ecology of migratory birds and their pathogens and parasites. Currently, my focus is on understanding the variation in bird migration (both in time and space), and how this variation is related to factors like climate change - check out the "Research" page for more!

Outside of work, I love running, baking, birding, backpacking and gardening.
