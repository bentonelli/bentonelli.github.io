I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA. My research uses big data to understand bird migration, and specifically how species and populations are responding to global change. Check out the "Research" page for more!

Outside of work, I like to run, bake/cook, and generally spend time outdoors.
