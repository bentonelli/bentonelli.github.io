I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> at UCLA in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department, where I study the movement ecology of migratory birds and their pathogens and parasites. Currently, my focus is on developing models for the migratory movements of individual birds - check out the "Research" page for more!

Outside of work, I love running, baking, birding, backpacking and gardening â€“ as much as one can in a small LA apartment!
