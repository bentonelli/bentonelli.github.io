I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.morgantingley.com/">Tingley Lab</a> in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology department at UCLA. My research uses ecological big data to understand how migratory birds are responding to global change. Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how changes to bird migration may impact disease dynamics in wildlife and human populations. Check out the "Research" page for more!

I try to focus on making my work accesible to non-scientists through the creation of "products" like the <a href="https://bentonelli.github.io/rarebirdforecast/">Rare Bird Forecast</a> (a dashboard that predicts avian vagrancy), the <a href="https://forms.gle/aq12BztcyijTAgE9A"> Early Bird Forecast</a> (a weekly email sent out during spring migration season that predicts what bird species will arrive in your area), and the <a href="https://bentonelli.github.io/botw/">Bird of the Week Newsletter</a> (this one is exactly what it sounds like), plus cool visualizations like the one below. You can read more about what this specific one is about <a href="https://bentonelli.github.io/Bird-Names-For-Birds-a-Map/">here</a>!

Outside of work, I like to run, bake/cook, and generally spend time outdoors.
