PLEASE READ: The Rare Bird Forecast relies on real-time data from the Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). As you may be aware, the Trump administration has initiated mass firings at NOAA, laying off 5% of the workforce so far. In addition to other avoidable problems, NOAAs Space Weather Prediction Center has recently seen delays in data reporting of upcoming solar storms, information that could potentially mitigate catastrophic damage to global satellite, communication networks, and the power grid that occurs during these events. 

NOAA is a miniscule part of the federal budget (a total of 6.3 billion per year, constituting less than 0.1% of spending). Compare that to the 6.3 billion Elon Musk’s businesses received in public federal grants last year. Despite its relatively small budget, NOAA provides a ton of critical weather information to other public agencies and the private sector free of charge. This information is both life-saving and cost-saving. In the past five years, severe weather events in the U.S. have killed 2,500 people, and led to at least $746 billion worth of damage.

With this in mind, please take this opportunity to consider how this administration’s actions to reduce scientific output and services may ultimately affect you and your family.

This forecast uses current geomagnetic conditions (and some other stuff) to predict the appearance of vagrant birds during the spring and fall migration seasons. You can read more about the methodology in [Tonelli et al, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-26586-0). If you are interested, check out this [recent paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2306317120) on the same phenomenon, measured via radar.
